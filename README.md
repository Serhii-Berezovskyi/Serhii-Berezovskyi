## Hi there 👋
I'm Serhii, a Manual QA Engineer based in Ukraine.

For now, I'm learning new technologies and tools, such as Jira, Trello, TestRail, Postman, MySQL, Git, and others, which will help me develop and grow in the QA field.
Also developing my written skills in making high-quality test documentation. 

Here you can find examples of my work.
